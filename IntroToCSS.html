    <p class="para">
        Typing is the process of writing or inputting text by pressing keys on a typewriter, computer keyboard, cell phone, or calculator. It can be distinguished from other means of text input, such as handwriting and speech recognition. Text can be in the form of letters, numbers and other symbols. The world's first typist was Lillian Sholes from Wisconsin,[1][2] the daughter of Christopher Sholes, who invented the first practical typewriter.

    Types of CSS
       * Inline CSS
       * Internal CSS
       * External CSS

Inline CSS: 
    here STYLE is used as a attribute for html elements
Internal CSS:
    here we use <style></style> inside the head tag to design the html elements
External CSS:
    here we create a new entire CSS file with extension .css 

    Link to the html page
    <link href="" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"

Priority 
    Inline    |
    Internal  |
    External  V
              
    here Inline css has higher priority than Internal css
    here Internal css has higher priority than  External css

    If all of them defined for an html page, Inline override the other two if there any.
    and same in the case of Internal and External CSS

In the css:
    we have Selectors and block of css statements.

    id(#) -> when we styling one html element at a time

    class(.) -> when we styling more than one html element at a time

    Note :
        when we have Selectors of same name, the prior one has highest precedence.
